# RESTAURANT RATING APP BY USING ANGULAR

* This app inlcuded 5 restaurants each of it has an button which is used to increase or decrease the rating of a particular restaurant.

* If rating goes below 2 a message will appear thet says that " Restaurant is super tasty!"

* If rating goes above 4 a message will appear thet says that "Restaurant is super tasty!"

## USING SERVICE WORKER

* Mainly a javascript file mainly consist of data which is used by our app.

* The file is linked by providing angular."<++ put file name here ++>"

* Angular is managing all the files of serviceWorker and Controller

## TECNIQUES THAT I LEARNED 
* However, before ANGULAR we manage all the functions stuff in another javascript file.But with ANGULAR we can dynamically controll the page by using concept of <ng - click>, <ng- if> and <ng-class> to controll the html page independently.

## SPECIAL NOTE 
* Angular files does not require any other external Library it is only the organation of files to manage the stuff.
